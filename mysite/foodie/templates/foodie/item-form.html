        The {% csrf_token %} tag is a Django template tag used to include a CSRF 
        (Cross-Site Request Forgery) token in forms that submit data via POST requests.
        This token is a security measure to protect your application from CSRF attacks,
        where malicious websites could trick users into submitting unauthorized requests
        to your server.
        When you include {% csrf_token %} inside a form, Django generates a unique token
        for the user's session and embeds it as a hidden input field in the form.
        The server then validates this token when the form is submitted to ensure the
        request is legitimate and originated from your application.
